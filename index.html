    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
    <p>I used to think that it was me against the world, but it wasn't</p>
    <p>Thought drinkin' from a glass half empty made it better, but it doesn't</p>
    <p>Funny all the things you realize
    When that 20/20 hindsight vision opens up your eyes</p>
  
   <p>[Chorus]</p>
   <p>Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be</p>
   <p>Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there</p>
   <p>Lookin' down and lookin' out for me</p>
  
  <p>[Verse 2]</p>
  <p>Something in my ramblin' soul said I had to go toe to toe with the devil</p>
  <p>Fell in love with a gypsy girl, said she couldn't risk it on a rebel</p>
  <p>At least not one that doesn't have a cause</p>
  <p>And I'll admit, I guess back thеn that's all I really was</p>
  
  <p>[Chorus]</p>
  <p>Now my outlook on life is differеnt than it used to be</p>
   <p>Lookin' down and lookin' out for me</p>
  
   <p>[Instrumental Break]</p>
  
   <p>[Bridge]</p>
   <p>There's so many crossroads you come to</p>
   <p>And you can't put your finger on</p>
   <p>Why you went the way you did, and then</p>
   <p>[Verse 3]</p>
   <p>You look up and here you are on the flip side of crazy</p>
   <p>It's something more than lucky stars you thank when you kiss your baby</p>
   <p>Always believed in God and angels in the sky</p>
  But never thought that I deserved an angel by my side</p>
  
   <p>[Chorus]</p>
   <p>Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be</p>
   <p>Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there</p>
   <p>Lookin' down and lookin' out for me</p>
   <p>Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be</p>
   <p>Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there</p>
   <p>Lookin' down and lookin' out for me</p>
  
   <p>[Outro]</p>
   <p>Yeah, lookin' down, lookin' out for me</p>
